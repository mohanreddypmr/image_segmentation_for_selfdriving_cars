# semantic_segmentation_for_self-driving_cars
semantic segmentation of images for self driving cars using segnet model with cityscapes dataset.we develop model using segnet architecture and train with cityscapes dataset.using kmeans to assign classes for each pixel for pixel wise training for semantic segmentation
# semantic segmentation
